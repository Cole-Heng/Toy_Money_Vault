# Toy_Money_Vault
## Cole Hengstebeck - ECE387 Final project



### Introduction
For my project, I will be making a money vault/locker for kids. The kid will be able to deposit and save money they have earned in a fun way to promote a mindset of saving and the value of money. They will be able to set a passcode to unlock and access their money just like a piggy bank.

### Parts and features
- An LCD screen - To act as a menu and see the code that is being typed
- Buttons to type in a passcode
- A servo motor - Sits on the inside to act as the locking mechanism for the door
- A tilt sensor - To detect motion if someone picks up the vault
- LEDs and a buzzer - An alarm if too many wrong guesses are entered or if the vault is moved

### Delivery
The deliverable for this project is a prototype vault where a user can set a passcode, lock and unlock the vault, and have the alarm system described above.
