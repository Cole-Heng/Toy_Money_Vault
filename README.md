# Toy_Money_Vault
## Cole Hengstebeck - ECE387 Final project



### Introduction
For my project, I have made a money vault/safe for kids. The kid can deposit and save money they have earned in a fun way to promote a mindset of saving and the value of money. They will be able to set a passcode to unlock and access their money just like a piggy bank.

### Parts and features
- An LCD screen - To act as a menu and see the code that is being typed
- Buttons to type in a passcode
- A servo motor - Sits on the inside to act as the locking mechanism for the door
- A tilt sensor - To detect motion if someone picks up the vault
- A buzzer - An alarm if too many wrong guesses are entered or if the vault is moved
- Custom 3D printed vault - STL files are in this repository
